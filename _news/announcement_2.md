Just started my new position as a Marie Curie Early-Stage Researcher in Paris, France.

The EU-funded Doctoral Network EDUCADO (Exploring the Deep Universe by Computational Analysis of Data from Observations) is composed of 11 junior scientist (PhD candidate) positions for its program on Galaxy Evolution and Big Data, where astronomers and computer scientists work together on big data algorithms, and apply them to the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies. The research will be carried out at nine European institutes in astronomy, computer science, and data science. Each position includes mandatory secondments of 3-6 months at another academic institution, and of typically two months at an associated partner in the private or public sector.
