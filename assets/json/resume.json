This also included organising events for the YoungESA community to connect with experienced colleagues and coordinating the activities during ESA Team Day and Open Day.",

We show that Metis plays the role of monitoring galactic and solar protons. The Metis particle observations are used for the diagnostics of the VL instrument performance and to study the spacecraft inner charging from solar minimum towards the next solar maximum. These achievements have been attained with the benefit of the joint observations of Metis, the Energetic Particle Detector/High Energy Telescope, and near-Earth and Earth-based instruments."

The outcome of this work can be used to estimate the Solar Orbiter instrument‚Äôs deep charging and the order of magnitude for energetic particles crossing the images of Metis and other instruments such as STIX and EUI."
