We show that Metis plays the role of monitoring galactic and solar protons. The Metis particle observations are used for the diagnostics of the VL instrument performance and to study the spacecraft inner charging from solar minimum towards the next solar maximum. These achievements have been attained with the benefit of the joint observations of Metis, the Energetic Particle Detector/High Energy Telescope, and near-Earth and Earth-based instruments."

      "summary": "The study of the role of abundant and rare cosmic rays in firing pixels in the Metis VL images of the corona allows us to estimate the efficiency of the algorithm applied for cosmic-ray track removal from the images and to demonstrate that the instrument performance had remained unchanged during the first two years of the Solar Orbiter operations. The outcome of this work can be used to estimate the Solar Orbiter instrument’s deep charging and the order of magnitude for energetic particles crossing the images of Metis and other instruments such as STIX and EUI."
