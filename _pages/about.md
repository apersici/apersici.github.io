ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Andrea Persici! 
I am a Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Fellow in AI/ML x Astrophysics, based in Paris. 

I am extremely fond of computer science and astronomy, and I have been working at the intersection between the two fields for a few years.

My main research focuses on improving faint object detection in deep astronomical surveys, using mathematical morphology and machine learning. Images from [Euclid](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid), [Rubin](https://www.lsst.org), and LIGHTS ([Large Binocular Telescope](https://www.lbto.org)) are key for this research.

I hold a M.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it) (Italy) and I am a former Research Intern at the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int) (Madrid, Spain) working for the Euclid mission in the Science and Operations Department.
