Last july, I attended the [AstroAI workshop](https://astroai.cfa.harvard.edu/workshop/details.html) at the [Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu) in Boston, USA.
The workshop spanned over the course of five days, with a series of lectures and discussions led by experts in the fields of AI/ML and astrophysics, hands on sessions, talks by early career scientists in the field, and networking events.

I had the chance to present my poster titled: *Blended Source Detection in Deep Fields: A Max-Tree Approach Informed by Survey and Simulated Data*. :smile:
